## Conclusion:

In all aspects of air transportation, safety must be the first concern for every airline. Poor aviation safety management has resulted in not just the financial losses connected with a single plane catastrophe, but also the loss of many precious human lives. Major incidents and fatal accidents happened due to crew error, and it is clear that crews were not trained efficiently due to a lack of technology. Whereas, the number of accidents
decreased as a result of technological advancements such as flight simulators, which artificially simulate aircraft flying in a variety of environments and situations. So, travellers should avoid airlines that are on a Blacklist, such as the one issued by the European Union on a regular basis or No-Fly list issued by the Indian Government etc.
